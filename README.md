# Modcol

This is a repository for base models that could be used to incapsulate logic

This project was created as a solution for another project 
to have stable base models and collection entities.

It will contain validations, some helper functions from lodash and 
minimum of api workers. There is also VUE in this project, just 
because our main project uses it and probably we will need something 
out of it.

*Warning:* Modcol is currently under development, please peace out!
